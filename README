VBoxWeb is a web interface for Sun's VirtualBox, using the Python XPCOM
bindings provided in the SDK.

To run VBoxWeb, you will need CherryPy (2.2 or newer) and the Genshi templating
engine. On Debian/Ubuntu systems the following command should give you
everything you need:

sudo apt-get install python-cherrypy python-genshi

Once you have the necessary packages installed, simply run vboxweb.py as the
user who owns the VMs you want to manage. Then point your browser to
http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and you should be good to go. Currently VBoxWeb is in
its infancy, and supports only a very few features of VirtualBox.

In the near future, expect to see the ability to run on alternate ports, as
well as a basic authentication system.
