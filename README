VBoxWeb is a web interface for Sun's VirtualBox, using the Python XPCOM
bindings provided in the SDK.

To run VBoxWeb, you will need CherryPy (3.0 or newer), the Genshi templating
engine, and the simplejson library.

http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Genshi
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson

Once you have the necessary prerequisites installed, simply run vboxweb.py as the
user who owns the VMs you want to manage. Then point your browser to
http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and you should be good to go. The default
username/password is vboxweb/vboxweb.

Currently VBoxWeb is in its infancy, and supports only a very few
features of VirtualBox.
